# AniPin Bot: Pinterest Automation Tool

## About This Project
This is an open-source automation tool for posting curated anime content to Pinterest. The project is being developed to explore the Pinterest API and the principles of social media automation for personal and educational purposes.

## App Purpose
1. App Name: AniPin Bot

2. Purpose/Description:
AniPin Bot is a specialized automation tool for personal, non-commercial use by an individual developer. Its purpose is to assist in the curation and sharing of high-quality anime-related content on the Pinterest platform for a personal account. This application is intended to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for content automation and to maintain an active presence on a single user's Pinterest account without the need for manual, day-to-day effort. The bot will be used solely to manage my own, personally curated content and will not be used for any commercial or bulk content purposes.

3. Key Features:

Single-Account Integration: The app is designed to work with a single, personal Pinterest account and will not be used to manage multiple accounts.

Content Curation: It will securely pull content from a pre-defined and user-approved list of sources, ensuring a continuous stream of fresh, relevant imagery for a single user's boards.

Responsible Pin Creation: The application will not be used for spamming. It will post a limited, reasonable number of Pins per day to ensure a high-quality user experience.

AI-Powered Tagging: The app will use AI to suggest and apply relevant and popular hashtags, improving content discoverability in a non-disruptive way.

4. Target Audience:
This tool is exclusively for an individual, hobbyist developer and is not intended for commercial use, public distribution, or use by other individuals or businesses.

5. Justification for Pinterest API Use:
The AniPin Bot requires access to the Pinterest API to programmatically create and publish Pins to my personal account. This includes permissions to create and manage Pins and boards. The application will strictly adhere to Pinterest's platform policies and terms of service, with a focus on responsible and respectful content sharing. The app will not be used for any activity that violates the Pinterest Developer Guidelines, including but not limited to:

Creating a high volume of Pins in a short period.

Spamming or posting irrelevant content.

Misleading users with inaccurate or deceptive information.

Engaging in any commercial activity.

This revised purpose explicitly states that the app is for personal use, which is a key distinction. It also addresses potential concerns about spam and commercial activity directly. Hopefully, this will get your application approved this time around!
## Key Features
* Automated Pin creation from a list of sources.
* Intelligent scheduling to maximize engagement.
* Auto-tagging and hashtag generation.
* Support for multiple boards.

## How It Works
The bot operates by fetching images and information from a pre-defined list of sources, processing the data to create a new Pin, and then posting it to a designated Pinterest board using the Pinterest API.
